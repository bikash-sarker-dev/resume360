        Dear Hiring Manager,
        </p>
        <p>
        I am writing to express my strong interest in the UX Designer position at Google. With a passion for crafting intuitive and user-focused digital experiences, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a company renowned for its design innovation, user-centric approach, and global impact.
        </p>
        <p>
        With a B.Sc. in Computer Science and over 2 years of hands-on experience in UX/UI design, I’ve led and contributed to projects across web and mobile platforms. At my previous role with DICT Company, I spearheaded a redesign project for a SaaS dashboard that increased user retention by 25% through streamlined navigation and enhanced usability. I specialize in using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch to create seamless, interactive prototypes, and I thrive in collaborative environments that blend creativity with data-driven design decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
        What draws me particularly to Google is your ability to combine cutting-edge technology with design simplicity. I have always admired projects like Google Material Design and the UX behind applications like Google Maps and Google Workspace. Being part of a team that shapes products used by billions of people would be both an honor and an exciting challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
        I bring with me not only technical expertise, but also a strong sense of empathy, curiosity, and a deep commitment to solving real-world problems through design. I would be thrilled to bring this mindset and skill set to Google’s design team and contribute to building experiences that truly make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
        Thank you for considering my application. I’ve attached my resume and portfolio for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your UX team at Google.
        </p>

        Warm regards,
